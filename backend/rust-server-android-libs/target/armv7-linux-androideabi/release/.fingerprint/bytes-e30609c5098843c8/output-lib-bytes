Examples:\n\n```\nstruct Something;\n\nimpl Something {} // ok!\n\n// or:\n\ntrait Foo {\n    type N;\n\n    fn bar(_: Self::N); // ok!\n}\n\n// or:\n\nfn foo<T>(x: T) {} // ok!\n```\n\nAnother case that causes this error is when a type is imported into a parent\nmodule. To fix this, you can follow the suggestion and use File directly or\n`use super::File;` which will import the types from the parent namespace. An\nexample that causes this error is below:\n\n```compile_fail,E0412\nuse std::fs::File;\n\nmod foo {\n    fn some_function(f: File) {}\n}\n```\n\n```\nuse std::fs::File;\n\nmod foo {\n    // either\n    use super::File;\n    // or\n    // use std::fs::File;\n    fn foo(f: File) {}\n}\n# fn main() {} // don't insert it for us; that'll break imports\n```\n"},"level":"error","spans":[{"file_name":"/Users/swithun/.cargo/registry/src/github.com-1ecc6299db9ec823/bytes-1.4.0/src/bytes_mut.rs","byte_start":29572,"byte_end":29578,"line_start":904,"line_end":904,"column_start":51,"column_end":57,"is_primary":true,"text":[{"text":"    fn try_unsplit(&mut self, other: BytesMut) -> Result<(), BytesMut> {","highlight_start":51,"highlight_end":57}],"label":"not found in this scope","suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null}],"children":[],"rendered":"\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;9merror[E0412]\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m: cannot find type `Result` in this scope\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m   \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m--> \u001b[0m\u001b[0m/Users/swithun/.cargo/registry/src/github.com-1ecc6299db9ec823/bytes-1.4.0/src/bytes_mut.rs:904:51\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m    \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m|\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m904\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m|\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m    fn try_unsplit(&mut self, other: BytesMut) -> Result<(), BytesMut> {\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m    \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m| \u001b[0m\u001b[0m                                                  \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;9m^^^^^^\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;9mnot found in this scope\u001b[0m\n\n"}
